Firefox container with bundled java, configured to support DRAC 6

DRAC 5 is not supported

# Usage

## Pull image
docker pull quay.io/brightbox/drac-browser

## Allow docker to connect to your xserver
xhost +local:docker

## Run Firefox from the image specifying the drac hostname, connecting to your display
docker run --net=host -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY --volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix quay.io/brightbox/drac-browser:latest firefox DRAC_HOSTNAME

# Troubleshooting
Your X11 socket may be in a different location so the --volume parameter may need adjustment eg --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:~/.X11-unix for a socket in your home directory.

# On iDRAC7
